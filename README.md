# Deliberāte

**Deliberāte: The community-based suggestion tool.**

Deliberāte is a tool that creators, team organizers, and other community-based groups or individuals can utilize to efficiently collect suggestions or feedback of any kind, from anyone. Any user can create their own channel and allow individuals to submit suggestions. Channels can be open, invite-based, or password protected, allowing you to decide who you accept suggestions from. When you receive suggestions or feedback, you can decide to accept or reject your submissions, and optionally allow your community to vote on your accepted suggestions, giving you the power to better understand which suggestions your community likes and dislikes.
